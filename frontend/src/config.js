  about:
    "<h4><b>I</b>nformation <b>M</b>anagement and e<b>X</b>change (DMART)</h4><p><em>Data management made easy.</em><hr/> <br/> DMART is a Unified Data Management (UDM) platform (aka Digital Asset Management) capable of assimilating varying forms of data that may be additionally enriched with metadata. <br/>Once assimilated the data is protected by access-control rules and is indexed for quick access and discoverability. Data can then be selectively published for public web access (SEO-enabled) like a regular CMS or restricted to specific users. IMX can be useful to both Enterprises and individuals to establish a data warehouse with digital presence where content can be published and collaborated upon by other users. </p>",
