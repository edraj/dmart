## Automated Load Testing Documentation using Locust

**Introduction**
Load testing is a crucial aspect of performance testing in software development, ensuring that the application can handle a certain level of traffic without performance degradation. Locust is a popular open-source load testing tool written in Python that allows you to define user behavior as code. This documentation provides guidelines and examples for automated load testing using Locust in the context of a web application.

**Setting Up**

Before writing load tests, ensure that you have Locust installed in your Python environment. You can install Locust via pip:

<img  class="center"  src={install-locust} >
  
**Writing Load Tests**

Locust allows you to define user behavior as tasks within a Python class. These tasks simulate user actions, such as making HTTP requests to your application endpoints. Here's an example of a Locust test file:
<img  class="center"  src={load-test} >

In the above example, MyUser is a subclass of HttpUser, representing a virtual user. The wait_time attribute defines the wait time between each task execution. The @task decorator defines a user task, which in this case is making a GET request to the /my-endpoint endpoint.

You can define multiple tasks within the user class to simulate various user behaviors.

**Running Load Tests**

To run load tests using Locust, navigate to the directory containing your test file and run the following command:

<img  class="center"  src={run-locust}  >

This will start the Locust web interface on http://localhost:8089, where you can specify the number of users to simulate and the hatch rate (i.e., how quickly users are spawned). Once you start the test, Locust will distribute user tasks across available workers and measure the performance of your application.

**Conclusion**  
Automated load testing with Locust offers a powerful and flexible framework for evaluating the performance of your web applications under various load conditions. By defining user behaviors as code, you can easily simulate realistic user scenarios and identify performance bottlenecks in your application. Use the guidelines provided in this documentation to conduct effective load tests and ensure the scalability and reliability of your web applications.
