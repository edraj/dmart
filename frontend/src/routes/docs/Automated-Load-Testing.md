**Automated Load Testing using Locust**

**Introduction**
Load testing is a crucial aspect of performance testing in software development, ensuring that the application can handle a certain level of traffic without performance degradation. Locust is a popular open-source load testing tool written in Python that allows you to define user behavior as code. This documentation provides guidelines and examples for automated load testing using Locust in the context of a web application.

**Setting Up**

Before writing load tests, ensure that you have Locust installed in your Python environment. You can install Locust via pip:

bash

    pip install locust

**Writing Load Tests**

Locust allows you to define user behavior as tasks within a Python class. These tasks simulate user actions, such as making HTTP requests to your application endpoints. Here's an example of a Locust test file:

python

    # my_load_test.py
    import time from locust import HttpUser, between, task
    class MyUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 2)
    @task
    def my_task(self):
    self.client.get("/my-endpoint")

In the above example, `MyUser` is a subclass of `HttpUser`, representing a virtual user. The `wait_time` attribute defines the wait time between each task execution. The `@task` decorator defines a user task, which in this case is making a GET request to the `/my-endpoint` endpoint.

You can define multiple tasks within the user class to simulate various user behaviors.

**Running Load Tests**

To run load tests using Locust, navigate to the directory containing your test file and run the following command:

bash

    locust -f my_load_test.py

This will start the Locust web interface on `http://localhost:8089`, where you can specify the number of users to simulate and the hatch rate (i.e., how quickly users are spawned). Once you start the test, Locust will distribute user tasks across available workers and measure the performance of your application.
