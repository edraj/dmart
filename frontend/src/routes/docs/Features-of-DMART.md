### Features of DMART

#### Unified API (Data-as-a-Service)

- **Description:** DMART provides a unified API that can directly service web and mobile frontends. The API is OpenAPI-compatible and uses JSON, facilitating easy integration and data exchange.
- **Benefits:** Simplifies the development process by providing a single API for all data interactions, ensuring consistency and ease of use.

#### Built-in User Management

- **Description:** DMART includes comprehensive user management features, allowing for easy user registration, authentication, and role management.
- **Benefits:** Reduces the need for additional user management systems, streamlining development and improving security.

#### Built-in Security Management (Permissions and Roles)

- **Description:** Security management in DMART includes permission and role-based access control, ensuring that users have appropriate access to data and functionality.
- **Benefits:** Enhances security by providing granular control over user access and actions within the system.

#### Extensibility by Plugins or Micro-Services

- **Description:** DMART is extensible through plugins or micro-services, leveraging JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure communication.
- **Benefits:** Allows for customization and extension of DMART's capabilities to meet specific business needs.

### Design Principles

#### Entry-Based Business-Oriented Data Definitions

- **Description:** DMART uses entry-based data definitions, eliminating the need for complex relational modeling and physical RDBMS table structures. Entries are extensible by metadata and can include structured, unstructured, and binary data.
- **Benefits:** Simplifies data management and enhances flexibility, allowing for easy adaptation to various business requirements.

#### Operational Store and Reconstruction

- **Description:** Data in DMART is stored in a file-based JSON format, enabling the operational store to be reconstructed from the file-based data. Changes to entries are tracked for auditing and review.
- **Benefits:** Ensures data integrity and provides a robust mechanism for auditing and data recovery.

#### Federation and Inter-Operation

- **Description:** DMART supports federated inter-operation, similar to the email (SMTP) concept, allowing different DMART instances to interact with each other. This includes messaging, content interaction (comments, reactions, shares), and user management.
- **Benefits:** Facilitates collaboration and data sharing across different DMART instances, enhancing the platform's versatility and reach.
