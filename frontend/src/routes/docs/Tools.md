### Command Line Tools (CLI)

Command Line Tools (CLI) are essential utilities that allow developers and administrators to manage, maintain, and interact with their applications directly from the terminal. These tools provide a streamlined and efficient way to perform various administrative and operational tasks without the need for a graphical interface.

The CLI tools documented here cover a range of functionalities necessary for the smooth operation of the application. From creating indices in Redis to ensure fast data retrieval, to checking the health of the application, generating secure password hashes, migrating database schemas, setting administrative passwords, and generating test data, these commands facilitate comprehensive management and maintenance of the application environment.

By leveraging these command line tools, users can automate routine tasks, enhance security, ensure the applicationâ€™s reliability, and maintain a consistent development workflow.
