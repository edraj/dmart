## **Automated Testing Documentation**

---

**Introduction**

Automated testing is a crucial practice in software development that involves using tools and scripts to automatically execute test cases, validate software functionality, and detect defects early in the development process. This documentation provides an overview of different types of automated testing, including

1. [Unit testing with Pytest](Automated-Testing-Pytest)

2. [Automated Load testing](Automated-Load-Testing)

3. [API testing with cURL.](Curl-sh)

4. [Automated testing with Pylint.](pylint)

**What is Pytest?**

Pytest is a widely used testing framework for writing simple and scalable test cases in Python. It provides easy-to-use syntax and powerful features for writing and executing tests.

**2. Load Testing with Locust**

**What is Locust?**

Locust is an open-source load testing tool written in Python. It allows you to define user behavior as code and simulate thousands of concurrent users to test the performance of your web applications.

**3. API Testing with cURL**

**What is cURL?**

cURL is a command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols. It is commonly used for testing APIs by sending HTTP requests and inspecting responses.

**Writing API Tests with cURL**

To write API tests with cURL, follow these steps:

1. Construct HTTP requests using cURL commands in the terminal.
2. Send requests to API endpoints and analyze the responses.
