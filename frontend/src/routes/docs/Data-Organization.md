# Data Organization in Dmart Nodes

In Dmart nodes, data is organized in a hierarchical structure to facilitate efficient management and access. This documentation outlines the data organization scheme within Dmart nodes, focusing on [spaces](Space), [subpaths](Subpath) & folders, [entries](Entries), and [attachments](Attachments).

**Hierarchical Structure**

At the top level of the data organization hierarchy are **spaces**. Spaces represent broad categories or business breakdowns of information groups. Each space serves as a container for organizing related data and resources.

### Components of Data Organization

### Spaces

- **Definition:** Spaces are top-level containers that categorize and organize related information groups.

- **Purpose:** Spaces provide a high-level organizational structure for grouping similar data.

- **Characteristics:** Each instance of DMart, being self-hosted, consists of multiple spaces. Spaces serve as independent containers for organizing data within a DMart node.

### Folders

- **Definition:** Folders are hierarchical structures within spaces used for further categorization and organization of data.

- **Purpose:** Folders help in organizing data into subcategories, providing a logical structure for data management.

- **Characteristics:** Folders exist within spaces and can contain other folders or entries.

### Entries

- **Definition:** Entries are individual units of business-relevant information stored within folders.

- **Purpose:** Entries represent specific data points or pieces of information relevant to the business context.

- **Characteristics:** Entries can include various attributes and metadata associated with the stored information.

### Attachments

- **Definition:** Attachments are extensible pieces of information and blobs associated with entries.

- **Purpose:** Attachments complement entries by providing additional context or supporting data.

- **Characteristics:** Attachments are linked to entries and can include various file types such as documents, images, or multimedia files.
