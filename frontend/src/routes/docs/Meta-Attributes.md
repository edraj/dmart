### **Meta Attributes**

---

In Dmart, the concept of "Meta Class" or "Meta fields" refers to the metadata associated with data entities within a Space. These metadata fields provide supplementary information about the data, such as creation timestamp, modification timestamp, creator user ID, or any other relevant information that describes the characteristics or history of the data entity.

**Purpose of Meta Class**

1.  **Metadata Management**: Meta fields in Dmart allow for the management of metadata associated with data entities within a Space. This metadata can include information about the data entity's creation, modification, ownership, or any other relevant attributes.

2.  **Auditing and Tracking**: Meta fields enable auditing and tracking of data changes by capturing metadata such as creation timestamp, modification timestamp, and user ID. This information helps in tracking the history of data modifications and identifying the users responsible for making changes.

3.  **Data Governance and Compliance**: Meta fields support data governance and compliance efforts by providing visibility into data lineage, ownership, and usage. Compliance requirements often mandate the tracking of data lineage and access, which can be facilitated through metadata management.

4.  **Customization and Extensibility**: Meta fields offer flexibility for customization and extensibility of metadata based on specific requirements. Users can define custom meta fields to capture additional information relevant to their use case, allowing for a tailored approach to metadata management.

**Key Features of Meta Class**

1.  **Standard Meta Fields**: Dmart provides a set of standard meta fields that capture common metadata attributes such as creation timestamp, modification timestamp, and user ID. These standard fields serve as a baseline for metadata management within a Space.

2.  **Custom Meta Fields**: Users can define custom meta fields to capture additional metadata attributes specific to their use case. Custom meta fields allow for the extension of metadata management capabilities to accommodate unique requirements and use cases.

3.  **Metadata Indexing**: Dmart supports indexing of meta fields, enabling efficient querying and retrieval of metadata information. Indexing meta fields improves query performance and facilitates advanced metadata-based searches within a Space.

**Attributes**

1.  **uuid**: The auto-generated unique identifier of the entry

2.  **shortname**: A unique name used to access the entry, can be assigned by the client or generated by the system using the `auto` magic word

3.  **slug**: used to retrieve the entry in `/byslug/{slug}` API, assigned by the client

4.  **is_active**: activate/deactivate the entry. You can later configure who can see active/inactive entries

5.  **displayname**: Like the title of the entry, object of the Translation\* class

6.  **description**: object of the Translation\* class

7.  **tags**: List of string tags

8.  **created_at**: the creation timestamp, auto generated

9.  **updated_at**: the modification timestamp, auto generated

10. **owner_shortname**: the shortname of the user who created this entry, auto generated, can be changed via the assign request type, explained at the Request Types Section

11. **owner_group_shortname**: the shortname of the group associated with this entry, the function is explained at the Groups section

12. **payload**: Contains the following attributes

- 12.1. **content_type**: the type of the data, supported types are listed below

- 12.2. **schema_shortname**: the shortname of the schema of this entry

- 12.3. **client_checksum**: optional field the client can provide and the system would validate the entry's data actual checksum according to the provided value

- 12.4. **body**: The actual data of the entry
