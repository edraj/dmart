**Step 1: System Setup**

1.  Business Portal: Create a business portal with an intuitive interface for business owners to set up their online store, manage product listings, pricing, and order types (e.g., delivery or pickup).
2.  User Registration: Allow business owners to register and create accounts on the platform, providing necessary details and business information.

**Step 2: Product Management**

3.  Product Upload: Provide an option for business owners to upload their product listings, including names, descriptions, prices, images, and categories.
4.  Inventory Management: Enable business owners to manage product availability, update stock levels, and specify delivery or pickup times.

**Step 3: QR Code Generation**

5.  Dynamic QR Code Generation: Generate unique QR codes for each business, product, and order type (e.g., delivery or pickup). These QR codes should link directly to the business's browse-to-order page or product details page.

**Step 4: Customer Experience**

6.  QR Code Scanning: Customers can scan the QR code displayed using their mobile devices' built-in camera or a QR code scanner app.
7.  Browse and Shop: Upon scanning the QR code, the customer's device opens a web page directly to the business's browse-and-shop page. This page displays product listings and details, allowing customers to add items to their virtual cart.
8.  Cart Review: Provide customers with the ability to review their shopping cart, make changes to quantities or selections, and see a summary of their order, including the total cost.
9.  Checkout and Payment: Allow customers to proceed to checkout. They should be able to choose a payment method (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet) and securely enter payment details to complete the order.
10. Order Confirmation: After successful payment, provide customers with an order confirmation screen that includes order details and an estimated delivery or pickup time (for applicable orders).

**Step 5: Business Notification**

11. Business Notification: Notify the business of new orders in real-time. Businesses should receive order details via email, SMS, or through a dedicated business management app. The notification should also include order specifics and customer details.

**Step 6: Order Fulfillment**

12. Order Preparation: The business staff prepares the order based on the received details, ensuring accuracy and quality.
13. Delivery or Pickup: Depending on the order type (e.g., delivery or pickup), customers can either have their order delivered to their location or pick it up from the business's designated pickup point.

**Step 7: Customer Feedback and Ratings**

14. Feedback and Ratings: After the shopping experience, invite customers to provide feedback. Use this feedback to improve service quality and product offerings.
