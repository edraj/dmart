## **Access Controls**

Access controls are a fundamental security feature within dmart. This module governs user permissions and determines what actions users can perform on your data assets. It ensures data security and integrity by restricting access based on predefined roles or user groups.

1.  **Permissions**

Permissions are granular controls within access controls. They define the specific actions a user or group is authorized to perform. This could include permissions for creating, editing, deleting, or viewing content within dmart.

2.  **Roles**

Roles represent collections of permissions bundled together. Assigning roles to users simplifies access control management. Users inherit the permissions associated with their assigned roles.

3.  **Groups**

Groups allow you to manage user access at a broader level. By assigning users to groups and granting permissions to those groups, you can efficiently control access for multiple users with similar needs.

4.  **Entry-level Access Control**

Entry-level access control likely refers to the default permissions applied to new users or data assets within dmart. This defines the baseline level of access before any specific roles or permissions are assigned.

5.  **Access Control List (ACL)**

The Access Control List (ACL) is a core component of the access control system. It defines the specific rules that govern user and group permissions for accessing, modifying, or interacting with data assets within dmart.
