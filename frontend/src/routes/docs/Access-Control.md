### **Access Controls**

---

Access controls are a fundamental security feature within **dmart**. This module governs user permissions and determines what actions users can perform on your data assets. It ensures data security and integrity by restricting access based on predefined roles or user groups.

---

#### **1. Permissions**

Permissions are granular controls within access controls. They define the specific actions a user or group is authorized to perform, such as:

- Creating content
- Editing content
- Deleting content
- Viewing content

---

#### **2. Roles**

Roles represent collections of permissions bundled together. Assigning roles to users simplifies access control management. Users inherit the permissions associated with their assigned roles. For example:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Editor**: Can create and edit content but not delete
- **Viewer**: Can only view content

---

#### **3. Groups**

Groups allow you to manage user access at a broader level. By assigning users to groups and granting permissions to those groups, you can efficiently control access for multiple users with similar needs. Common groups include:

- **Marketing Team**
- **Development Team**
- **Support Team**

---

#### **4. Entry-level Access Control**

Entry-level access control refers to the default permissions applied to new users or data assets within **dmart**. This defines the baseline level of access before any specific roles or permissions are assigned. For example:

- New users might have **Viewer** access by default
- New data assets might be **read-only** until permissions are configured

---

#### **5. Access Control List (ACL)**

The Access Control List (ACL) is a core component of the access control system. It defines the specific rules that govern user and group permissions for accessing, modifying, or interacting with data assets within **dmart**. Key elements include:

- **User Permissions**: Specific actions allowed for individual users
- **Group Permissions**: Permissions granted to user groups
- **Inheritance Rules**: How permissions are inherited from roles or groups

By utilizing these access controls, **dmart** ensures robust data security and streamlined management of user permissions.
