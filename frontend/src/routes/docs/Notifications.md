## Notifications

The notification module keeps users informed about important events or activities within your dmart application. It allows for sending targeted messages to users based on various criteria.

1.  **Configure notification channels (Firebase, Websocket, and SMS):**

This functionality empowers you to define how notifications are delivered. You can integrate with services like Firebase for push notifications, leverage websockets for real-time updates, or configure SMS delivery for critical alerts.

2. **Periodically-sent and configurable admin notifications (Marketing Campaigns):**

Dmart allows you to create and schedule automated notification campaigns. This can be beneficial for sending marketing messages, system updates, or other announcements to your users at designated intervals.

3.  **Fully-managed and configurable event-based notifications:**

Dmart can trigger notifications based on specific events or actions within your application. You can define custom notification rules to keep users informed about relevant activities, such as new content creation or approval workflows.

4.  **Websocket channel-based notifications:-**

Websockets provide a mechanism for real-time, two-way communication between dmart and user devices. This module allows for sending instant notifications through dedicated websocket channels for a more interactive user experience.
