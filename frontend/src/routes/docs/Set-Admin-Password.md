## Password Generation and Storage

### Purpose:

The script is designed to generate a password, hash it, and store it securely for administrative and test user accounts. Additionally, it creates a shell script with the login credentials for further usage.

### Usage:

The script is intended to be executed as a standalone Python script. It can be run directly from the command line.

### Dependencies:

- Python 3

- `getpass`

- `subprocess`

- `utils.password_hashing.hash_password`

- `utils.settings.settings`

- `utils.regex`

- `json`

### Execution:

To execute the script, run it using Python 3 from the command line:

bash

`python3 <script_filename>.py`

### Description:

1. **Shebang Line**:

- The script starts with a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env -S BACKEND_ENV=config.env python3`) to specify the Python interpreter and environment settings.

2. **Imports**:

- The script imports necessary modules and libraries required for its functionality, including modules from custom packages and standard Python libraries.

3. **User Input**:

- The script prompts the user to enter a password, ensuring it meets certain complexity rules (minimum 8 characters, alphanumeric mix, with special characters).

4. **Password Hashing**:

- The entered password is hashed using a secure hashing algorithm (function `hash_password` from `utils.password_hashing`).

5. **Password Storage**:

- The hashed password is stored securely for administrative and test user accounts.

- It updates the password field in the JSON files corresponding to the user accounts (`management/users/.dm/<username>/meta.user.json`).

6. **Login Credentials Script**:

- The script creates a shell script (`login_creds.sh`) containing the login credentials for further usage.

- It substitutes placeholders in a sample shell script (`login_creds.sh.sample`) with the actual password.

### Notes:

- The script ensures password security by hashing it before storage, enhancing data protection.

- It utilizes regular expressions to enforce password complexity rules.

- Error handling for invalid input or file operations is not explicitly implemented in the script.
