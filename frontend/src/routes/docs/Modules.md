## - Modules:

Here's a breakdown of some key modules within dmart:

   **- Redis [Optional Operation DB]**
While dmart likely has a primary data storage mechanism, Redis can be optionally integrated as a secondary operational database. Redis is a high-performance in-memory data store that excels in caching, real-time data processing, and leaderboards. Integrating Redis can potentially enhance performance for specific use cases within your dmart application.

 1. **Enable/Disable**

This module offers functionalities for managing the activation state of various features or functionalities within dmart. You can selectively enable or disable modules based on your application's requirements.

 2. **Search**

The search module empowers users to efficiently locate specific data assets within your dmart application. It allows for full-text search capabilities, potentially including filtering and sorting options to refine search results.

 3. **Aggregation**

The aggregation module enables you to perform calculations and summaries on your dmart data. This allows you to extract insights by grouping and processing data sets. For example, you could calculate total sales figures across different product categories.

**-Access Controls**
Access controls are a fundamental security feature within dmart. This module governs user permissions and determines what actions users can perform on your data assets. It ensures data security and integrity by restricting access based on predefined roles or user groups.


 1. **Permissions**

Permissions are granular controls within access controls. They define the specific actions a user or group is authorized to perform. This could include permissions for creating, editing, deleting, or viewing content within dmart.

 2. **Roles**

Roles represent collections of permissions bundled together. Assigning roles to users simplifies access control management. Users inherit the permissions associated with their assigned roles.

 3. **Groups**

Groups allow you to manage user access at a broader level. By assigning users to groups and granting permissions to those groups, you can efficiently control access for multiple users with similar needs.

4. **Entry-level Access Control**

Entry-level access control likely refers to the default permissions applied to new users or data assets within dmart. This defines the baseline level of access before any specific roles or permissions are assigned.

 5. **Access Control List (ACL)**

The Access Control List (ACL) is a core component of the access control system. It defines the specific rules that govern user and group permissions for accessing, modifying, or interacting with data assets within dmart.


**- Notifications**
The notification module keeps users informed about important events or activities within your dmart application. It allows for sending targeted messages to users based on various criteria.

 1. **Configure notification channels (Firebase, Websocket, and SMS):-**
 This functionality empowers you to define how notifications are delivered. You can integrate with services like Firebase for push notifications, leverage websockets for real-time updates, or configure SMS delivery for critical alerts.

 2. **Periodically-sent and configurable admin notifications (Marketing
    Campaigns):-**
Dmart allows you to create and schedule automated notification campaigns. This can be beneficial for sending marketing messages, system updates, or other announcements to your users at designated intervals.

 3. **Fully-managed and configurable event-based notifications:-**
 Dmart can trigger notifications based on specific events or actions within your application. You can define custom notification rules to keep users informed about relevant activities, such as new content creation or approval workflows.

4.  **Websocket channel-based notifications:-**
 Websockets provide a mechanism for real-time, two-way communication between dmart and user devices. This module allows for sending instant notifications through dedicated websocket channels for a more interactive user experience.

**- Action Logging and Query the Logged Actions**
Dmart maintains a log of user actions performed within the application. This module allows you to:
	- Track all actions taken by users on your data assets.
	- Query and analyze these logs for auditing purposes or to gain insights into user behavior.

   **- Saved Queries**
The saved queries functionality enables you to define and store frequently used search queries within dmart. This allows for quick retrieval of specific data sets or reports without having to redefine the search parameters each time.

   **- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):**
Dmart can potentially integrate with LDAP directory services. This allows for leveraging existing user authentication mechanisms within your organization for dmart logins. Users would then authenticate using their LDAP credentials.

   **- Importer & Exporter**
These modules facilitate data migration between dmart and external systems.

**- Importer:-**  
 Enables you to import data from various sources into your dmart application. This can be useful for populating your application with initial data sets or migrating content from legacy systems.
**- Exporter:-**   
Allows you to export data from dmart into external formats. This provides a way to back up your data or share it with other applications.

 **- System Logs:-**
Dmart maintains system logs that record various system events and activities. These logs can be helpful for troubleshooting issues, monitoring system health, or performing security audits.

**- Data Integrity Inspection (Health Check):-**
This functionality likely provides a mechanism to verify the consistency and accuracy of your data within dmart. It can help identify and rectify any data corruption or inconsistencies that might arise.
 **- Develop and Register Custom Plugin:-**
Dmart potentially offers an extension mechanism through which you can develop and register custom plugins. These plugins can extend dmart's functionalities to cater to specific needs or integrate with external services not natively supported by the platform.
