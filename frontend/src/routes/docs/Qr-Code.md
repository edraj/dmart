### **QR Code Order System**

---

DMART provides QR code functionality out of the box, which can be employed in food ordering solutions (from inside the restaurant), where customers can scan a QR code and be redirected to a browse-to-order experience. This is a practical and convenient way to enhance the dining experience for customers.

**Step 1: System Setup**

1.  Restaurant Portal: Create a restaurant portal with an intuitive interface for restaurant owners to manage menus, items, pricing, table assignments, and order types (dine-in or takeout).
2.  User Registration: Allow restaurant owners to register and create accounts on the platform, providing necessary details and restaurant information.

**Step 2: Restaurant Menu Management**

3.  Menu Upload: Provide an option for restaurant owners to upload their menu items, including item names, descriptions, prices, and images. Allow them to categorize items (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).
4.  Item Availability: Enable restaurant owners to set item availability times and dates. Ensure that items are displayed to customers only when they are available for order.

**Step 3: QR Code Generation**

5.  QR Code Generation: For each table and order type (dine-in or takeout) within the restaurant, generate a unique QR code that links directly to the restaurant's browse-to-order page. The QR code should contain a URL with parameters specifying the table number and order type.

For example:

- [https://restaurantwebsite.com/order?table=12&type=dine-in](https://restaurantwebsite.com/order?table=12&type=dine-in)
- [https://restaurantwebsite.com/order?table=5&type=takeout](https://restaurantwebsite.com/order?table=5&type=takeout)

**Step 4: Customer Experience**

6.  QR Code Scanning: Customers can scan the QR code displayed at their table or provided for takeout orders using their mobile devices' built-in camera or a QR code scanner app.
7.  Browse-to-Order Page: Upon scanning the QR code, the customer's device opens a web page directly to the restaurant's browse-to-order page. This page detects the table number and order type from the QR code parameters and displays the relevant menu items.
8.  Order Customization: Customers can browse the menu, select items they want to order, customize items (e.g., specifying options, quantities), and add them to their virtual cart.
9.  Order Review: Provide customers with the ability to review their order, make changes, and see a summary of their selections, including the total cost.
10. Checkout and Payment: Allow customers to proceed to checkout. They should be able to choose a payment method (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet) and securely enter payment details to complete the order.
11. Order Confirmation: After successful payment, provide customers with an order confirmation screen that includes order details and an estimated delivery or pickup time (for takeout orders).

**Step 5: Restaurant Notification**

12. Restaurant Notification: Notify the restaurant of the new order in real-time. Restaurants should receive order details via platform, email, SMS, or through a dedicated restaurant management app. The notification should also include the table number and order type.

**Step 6: Order Fulfillment**

13. Order Preparation: The restaurant staff prepares the order based on the received details, ensuring accuracy and quality.
14. Delivery or Pickup: Depending on the order type (dine-in or takeout), customers can either have their order delivered to their table or pick it up from the restaurant counter.

**Step 7: Customer Feedback and Ratings**

15. Feedback and Ratings: After the meal, invite customers to provide feedback and ratings for their dining experience. Use this feedback to improve service quality.

**Step 8: Support and Maintenance**

16. Customer Support: Provide customer support channels (e.g., chat, email, phone) for addressing any issues or inquiries related to the browse-to-order system.
17. System Maintenance: Regularly update and maintain the platform to ensure it operates smoothly, securely, and efficiently.
