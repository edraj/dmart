### **Health Check API**

---

**Overview:** Health Check API is a Python script designed for conducting health checks on a system. The script is intended to evaluate the health and integrity of data stored . It supports two modes of operation: soft and hard health checks.

**Usage:** The script can be executed from the command line with various parameters to specify the type of health check, target space, target schemas, and branch.

**Command Line Arguments:**

- `-t, --type`: Specifies the type of health check to perform. Valid options are "soft" or "hard".

- `-s, --space`: Specifies the target space for the health check. "all" can be specified to perform a health check on all spaces.

- `-b, --branch`: Specifies the target branch for the health check.

- `-m, --schemas`: Specifies the target schemas within the space for the health check.

**Dependencies:**

- `asyncio`: For asynchronous programming.

- `argparse`: For parsing command line arguments.

- `json`: For handling JSON data.

- `os`, `shutil`, `sys`, `time`: For file and system operations.

- `datetime`, `pathlib`: For handling date/time and file paths.

- `jsonschema`: For validating JSON data against schemas.

- External dependencies: `redis`, `api`, `models`, `utils`.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Soft Health Check (`soft_health_check`):**

- Performs a soft health check on the specified space and schema.

- Iterates through the documents in the specified space and validates them against the schema.

- Identifies valid and invalid entries, and collects relevant information.

- Reports the health check results including valid and invalid entries.

2.  **Hard Health Check (`hard_health_check`):**

- Performs a hard health check on the specified space.

- Validates the data structure and integrity of documents within the space.

- Reports any invalid folders or documents found during the check.
