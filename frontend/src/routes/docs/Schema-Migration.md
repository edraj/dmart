### **Schema Migration Script**

---

**Introduction:** This script facilitates schema migration within a system, allowing users to change the type of a field in a specific schema under a particular space. It automates the process of updating the schema definition along with all associated resources to reflect the changes in the field type. This documentation provides an overview of the script's functionality, usage, and key components.

**Script Overview:**

- **Purpose:** Schema migration to change the type of a field in a specific schema under a particular space.
- **Language:** Python 3.
- **Dependencies:**
  - `argparse`: For parsing command-line arguments.
  - `asyncio`: For asynchronous I/O operations.
  - `enum`: For creating enumerated constants.
  - `re`: For regular expressions.
  - Other custom modules for database operations, schema manipulation, and settings management.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Main Function (`main`):**

    - Entry point of the script.
    - Handles command-line arguments and invokes the necessary functions to perform schema migration.
    - Loads the specified schema, verifies the existence of the specified field with the old type, and updates its type to the new specified type.

2.  **Change Field Type Function (`change_field_type`):**

    - Changes the type of the specified field in the schema to the new specified type.
    - Updates the schema payload and recursively traverses through all resources associated with the schema in the given space, updating the field type in each resource.

3.  **Field Type Enum (`FieldType`):**

    - Enumeration defining supported field types such as string, number, integer, and array.

4.  **Field Type Parser Dictionary (`FIELD_TYPE_PARSER`):**

    - Dictionary mapping field types to their corresponding Python types for parsing during type conversion.

**Command-line Arguments:**

- `-p, --space`: Specifies the name of the space.
- `-c, --schema`: Specifies the name of the schema.
- `-f, --field`: Specifies the name of the field to change.
- `--old-type`: Specifies the old type of the field (supported types: string, number, integer, array).
- `--new-type`: Specifies the new type of the field (supported types: string, number, integer, array).

**Usage Example:**

bash

`python schema_migration.py -p products -c offer -f price --old-type string --new-type number`

This command changes the type of the "price" field in the "offer" schema under the "products" space from string to number.

**Conclusion:** The provided script streamlines the process of schema migration, enabling users to evolve their system schemas efficiently. By automating the update of schema definitions and associated resources, it ensures consistency and integrity across the system's data model.
