### Automated Testing with Pylint, Pyright, Ruff, and Mypy

---

**Introduction**

This section provides details on integrating Pylint into your existing DMART Python project alongside Pyright, Ruff, and Mypy. These tools collectively enhance code quality by performing static type checking, code analysis, and linting.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that Python is installed and properly set up in your development environment. Additionally, the following tools must be installed:

- Pylint
- Pyright
- Ruff
- Mypy

You can install these tools using pip:

bash

`pip install pylint pyright ruff mypy`

**Setting Up Automated Testing**

**Pylint**

Pylint is a static code analyzer that helps identify programming errors, enforce coding standards, and detect code smells.

**Configuration**

To customize Pylintâ€™s behavior, generate a `.pylintrc` configuration file:

bash

`pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc`

Modify the `.pylintrc` file to match the requirements. Common adjustments include:

- Maximum line length
- Enabling/disabling specific checks
- Customizing naming conventions

**Pyright**

Pyright is a static type checker for Python, designed to ensure that your type annotations are correct.

**Ruff**

Ruff is a linter that quickly analyzes code for issues.

**Mypy**

Mypy is another static type checker for Python, focused on enforcing type annotations and ensuring type safety.

### Running Automated Tests

**Creating a Shell Script**

To run all the tools in sequence, create a shell script named `run_linters.sh` with the following content:

bash

```
#!/bin/bash
echo"Running Pyright ..."
 python -m pyright

echo "Running Ruff ..."
python -m ruff check .

echo "Running Mypy ..."
 python -m mypy --explicit-package-bases --warn-return-any .

echo "Running Pylint ..."
 pylint your_project/

```

Replace `your_project/` with the appropriate path to your Python package or module.

**Making the Script Executable**
Ensure the script is executable by running:

bash

`chmod +x run_linters.sh`

### Executing the Script

Run the script to perform static code analysis with all four tools:

bash

`./run_linters.sh`

## Integrating with Continuous Integration (CI)

Automate the linting and static analysis process by integrating the script into your CI/CD pipeline. Below is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow configuration:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file named `.github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml` with the following content:

```

name: Lint and Test

on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
	lint:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
		 - name: Checkout code
		   uses: actions/checkout@v2

		- name: Set up Python
		  uses: actions/setup-python@v2
		  with:
			  python-version: '3.x'
		- name: Install dependencies
		  run: |
		   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
		   pip install pylint pyright ruff mypy
	 - name: Run linters
	   run: ./run_linters.sh
```

This workflow runs the `run_linters.sh` script on every push and pull request, ensuring that your codebase remains consistent and adheres to the defined quality standards.

## **Conclusion**

By integrating Pylint, Pyright, Ruff, and Mypy into your automated testing workflow, you can significantly enhance the quality and maintainability of your DMART Python project. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and running these tools, ensuring your codebase remains clean, efficient, and error-free.
