### **Automated Testing with Pylint, Pyright, Ruff, and Mypy**

---

**Introduction**

This section provides details on integrating Pylint into your existing DMART Python project alongside Pyright, Ruff, and Mypy. These tools collectively enhance code quality by performing static type checking, code analysis, and linting.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that Python is installed and properly set up in your development environment. Additionally, the following tools must be installed:

- Pylint
- Pyright
- Ruff
- Mypy

You can install these tools using pip:

bash

```
pip install pylint pyright ruff mypy
```

**Setting Up Pylint**

**Pylint**

Pylint is a static code analyzer that helps identify programming errors, enforce coding standards, and detect code smells.

**Configuration**

To customize Pylintâ€™s behavior, generate a `.pylintrc` configuration file:

bash
./

```
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
```

Modify the `.pylintrc` file to match the requirements. Common adjustments include:

- Maximum line length

- Enabling/disabling specific checks

- Customizing naming conventions

**Pyright**

Pyright is a static type checker for Python, designed to ensure that your type annotations are correct.

**Ruff**

Ruff is a linter that quickly analyzes code for issues.

**Mypy**

Mypy is another static type checker for Python, focused on enforcing type annotations and ensuring type safety.

** Running Automated Tests**

**Creating a Shell Script**

To run all the tools in sequence, create a shell script named `run_linters.sh` with the following content:

bash

```

#!/bin/bash

echo"Running Pyright ..."

python -m pyright



echo "Running Ruff ..."

python -m ruff check .



echo "Running Mypy ..."

python -m mypy --explicit-package-bases --warn-return-any .



echo "Running Pylint ..."

pylint your_project/



```

Replace `your_project/` with the appropriate path to your Python package or module.

**Making the Script Executable**

Ensure the script is executable by running:

bash

```
chmod +x run_linters.sh
```

** Executing the Script**

Run the script to perform static code analysis with all four tools:

bash

```
./run_linters.sh
```

**Another Example to run it**

```bash
cd backend

# Start the pylint
./pylint.sh
```

**Conclusion**

By integrating Pylint, Pyright, Ruff, and Mypy into your automated testing workflow, you can significantly enhance the quality and maintainability of your DMART Python project. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and running these tools, ensuring your codebase remains clean, efficient, and error-free.
